            Every Tuesday and Thursday at 8:30 a.m., I walk along the Highline, a windy path between the residential 
            colleges at NYU Abu Dhabi to get to my Communications Lab class.  <br><br>
            
            Every Tuesday and Thursday, on that walk, I see happy faces, lovely cats and kittens, beautiful skies, 
            chirping birds, and plenty of other reasons to enjoy smile. <br><br>
            
            In this film, I invite you to accompany me on one such walk – I Hope it gets as many smiles out of you as how many I received :) <br><br>

            <p class="caption"> Hi! My name's Sarah. People close to me call me Sare, the nickname my young sister
                gave to me three years ago. I am the person behind the camera – I give a sneaky wave at the end though. 
                I am a student at NYU Abu Dhabi and, in this short "vlog," I document a snippet of what I see when I am walking back
                to my residential building from class.

                she shows up uninvited, jumps on my table, and nibbles on my food). We chatter and gossip together (as in me whining about frustrating human stuff 
                that her cat brain can't understand). She ditches me all the time for food or other people, like you see in the video. I still love her though.

                I owe all my happy mornings to the Public Safety in the Art Center whose gentle smile and happy demanor never fail to energize me for the rest of the day.
