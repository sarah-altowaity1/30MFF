            Every Tuesday and Thursday at 8:30 in the morning, I walk along the Highline, a twisty path between the residential 
            colleges at NYU Abu Dhabi, to get to my Communications Lab class.  <br><br>
            
            Every Tuesday and Thursday, on that walk, I see happy faces, lovely cats and kittens, beautiful skies, 
            chirping birds, and plenty of other reasons to smile. <br><br>
            
            In this film, I invite you to accompany me on one such walk â€“Â I hope it gets as many smiles out of you as filming it got out me :)<br><br>

                I am a student at NYU Abu Dhabi and, in this short "vlog," I document a snippet of what I see when I am walking back
                to my residential building from class.

                she shows up uninvited, jumps on my table, and nibbles on my food. We chatter and gossip together â€“Â as in I whine about frustrating human stuff 
                that her cat brain can't understand. She ditches me all the time for food o other people, like you see in the video. I still love her though and seeing her on
                my walks on campus make me happy.
